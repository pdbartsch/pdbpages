      <description>The problem: It&amp;rsquo;s tough to keep an ever changing underground utility model up to date. It is especially difficult when your audience uses a variety of methods to access that data. The majority of my audience accesses this data via hosted PDFs but an ever growing group is now using ArcGIS Explorer and ArcGIS Collector on smartphones and tablets to access the same set of data.
Since I manage the GIS data model of over ten types of utilities across multiple formats it was becoming quite common for a change to be made on my desktop but then either the PDF print or ArcGIS Online hosted data to be out of sync.</description>

      <description>Quick Background: I work at UC Santa Barbara and one of my many jobs is to keep our underground utility atlas up to date. This atlas is accessed in multiple formats including PDF, desktop, and mobile applications. The campus atlas sheets are broken up to 500x500 foot grids which each represent a single sheet when printed or viewed as a PDF. The entire Santa Barbara campus makes up just over 300 of these grids.</description>
